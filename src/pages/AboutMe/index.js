                        Juliana Wilcox is a musician and a mother of three. She grew up playing in a string quartet with her siblings and singing. As a mother surrounded by boys,
                        she often feels like a boy scout camp cook captured by wild hoards of neighborhood children who run around the house eating all of her food. Juliana taught
                        elementary school for thirteen years, had a violin and piano studio for twenty years, and has recently left the education field to embrace her love of technology
                        and invest her time in full stack web development. Her free time is spent dreaming of living in Norway with her relatives and traveling the world with
                        (and often without) her children.
